The focus of this project was to practice with more advanced forms. This mainly deals with nested forms, using the 'fields_for' form, along with specifications on the params in those forms. I also used JavaScript to dynamically delete my flash messages. Additionally, I spent a couple of days styling my views with SCSS as well as a CSS framework (Bulma).
